licensing stuff wrt pulling in shiboken subcomponents into repo?

shiboken:
  make dumpcodemodel output better
    *1 less guessing at stuff in the analysis stage / less analysis stage / more capabilities 


transitive.py:
  gen.py but gen the whole dep graph
    improve filtering, inference (obsoleted by *1 ?)

some kind of spec format, if necessary, for specifying spec rules, filters/exceptions, ...?
